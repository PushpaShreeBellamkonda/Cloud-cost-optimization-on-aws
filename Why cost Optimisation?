# Why cost Optimization
-Assume we have created an EC2 and also taken some snapshots (backups) of it.   
-We might delete the instance but forgot to delete its volume.
-Then obviously aws will cost for it and for snapshots
-Also we created an s3 bucket and uploaded an object and using it for long time ,then we also we will be charged        
# Stale resources : 
Resources  that   have been using since very long but not deleting them.
Now devops engineer will take care of this issue
**Example** : we created an c2 instance and created few snapshots
Case 1 : only ec2 is deleted
Case 2 : ec2 and its volume is also deleted
In both cases snapshots are not deleted, this is the problem statement
-To solve this  we write a lambda function in python 
-The lambda function will interact with AWS API and does the following
         **Step 1** Fetch all EBS snapshots
         **Step 2** Filter snapshots that are stale
